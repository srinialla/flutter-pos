## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (3.0.0 or higher)
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Firebase account

### 2. Clone and Install Dependencies
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd pos_flutter_app
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Generate Hive Adapters
```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner build
```

### 4. Firebase Setup

#### Option A: Use Existing Configuration
The app includes placeholder Firebase configuration. For development, you can:
1. Replace the placeholder values in `lib/core/config/firebase_config.dart`
2. Add your `google-services.json` to `android/app/`
3. Add your `GoogleService-Info.plist` to `ios/Runner/`

#### Option B: Generate New Configuration
1. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Enable Authentication and Firestore
3. Run `flutterfire configure` (requires FlutterFire CLI)
4. Follow the prompts to set up platforms

### 5. Android Setup
```bash
# For Android, ensure you have the required permissions in AndroidManifest.xml
# (already configured in this project)
```

### 6. Run the App
```bash
flutter run
```

## Firebase Configuration

### Authentication
- Enable Email/Password authentication in Firebase Console
- Optionally enable Google Sign-In

### Firestore Database
Create the following collections structure:
```
users/{userId}/
  â”œâ”€â”€ products/
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ {productId}
  â””â”€â”€ sales/
      â””â”€â”€ {saleId}
```

### Security Rules Example
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Demo Credentials
For testing purposes, use:
- **Email**: demo@example.com
- **Password**: demo123

### Getting Started
1. **Login**: Use demo credentials or create a new account
2. **Add Products**: Navigate to Products â†’ Add Product
3. **Scan Barcodes**: Use the Scanner to add products by barcode
4. **Make Sales**: Go to Sales â†’ Add products to cart â†’ Checkout
5. **View Analytics**: Dashboard shows sales statistics and inventory status

### Sample Data
The app can generate sample products for testing:
- Go to Products screen
- The app will prompt to add sample data if no products exist

## Key Components

### Local Storage (Hive)
- **Products**: Stored in local Hive database
- **Sales**: Complete transaction history
- **Settings**: App preferences and configuration
- **Offline Mode**: Full CRUD operations work offline

### Barcode Scanning
Supported formats:
- EAN-13, EAN-8
- UPC-A, UPC-E
- Code 128, Code 39
- QR Codes

### Sales Flow
1. Add products to cart (scan or search)
2. Modify quantities and apply discounts
3. Calculate tax and total
4. Select payment method
5. Process payment and generate receipt
6. Update inventory automatically

### Sync Process
1. **Upload**: Local changes pushed to Firebase
2. **Download**: Remote changes pulled from Firebase
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Latest timestamp wins
4. **Status Tracking**: Visual indicators for sync status

## Development

### Adding New Features
1. **Models**: Add to `lib/core/models/`
2. **Services**: Business logic in `lib/core/services/`
3. **Providers**: State management in `lib/providers/`
4. **UI**: Screens in `lib/screens/`

### Running Tests
```bash
flutter test
```

### Building for Release
```bash
# Android
flutter build apk --release

# iOS
flutter build ios --release
```

## Dependencies

### Core
- `flutter`: UI framework
- `provider`: State management
- `hive`: Local database
- `firebase_core`, `firebase_auth`, `cloud_firestore`: Firebase services

### UI/UX
- `google_fonts`: Typography
- `go_router`: Navigation
- `material_components_flutter`: Material Design

### Features
- `mobile_scanner`: Barcode scanning
- `connectivity_plus`: Network status
- `permission_handler`: Device permissions
- `image_picker`: Image handling
- `intl`: Internationalization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Runner Issues**:
```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner clean
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

**Firebase Connection Issues**:
- Verify `google-services.json` is in the correct location
- Check Firebase project configuration
- Ensure internet connectivity for initial sync

**Permission Issues**:
- Camera permission required for barcode scanning
- Storage permission for image handling
- Network permission for sync

### Performance
- Local data is cached for fast access
- Images are stored as base64 (consider optimizing for production)
- Sync happens in background to avoid UI blocking
